# Windows Automation Toolkit - Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the step-by-step implementation of features for the Windows Automation Toolkit using the MVP and sprint iteration technique. Focus on one feature at a time and complete each task before moving on to the next.

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Project Initialization
- [x] **Create GitHub Repository**
  - [x] Set up a new repository for the project on GitHub.
  - [x] Add a `README.md` file and `.gitignore` for C# and Windows projects.

- [ ] **Set Up Development Environment**
  - [ ] Install Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Code) with necessary extensions for C#.
  - [ ] Install .NET SDK if not already installed.
  - [ ] Install any other tools or libraries needed (e.g., PowerShell modules).

- [ ] **Create Windows Forms Application**
  - [ ] Initialize a new Windows Forms project in Visual Studio.
  - [ ] Set up the project structure with folders for scripts, assets, and documentation.

- [ ] **Version Control Setup**
  - [ ] Connect the project to the GitHub repository.
  - [ ] Create an initial commit with the basic project structure.

### Step 2: Basic Application Framework
- [ ] **Design Basic GUI Framework**
  - [ ] Create the main application window with a sidebar and header.
  - [ ] Set up placeholders for different sections (System Maintenance, User Management, etc.).
  - [ ] Implement a basic navigation system to switch between sections.

- [ ] **Build Navigation Functionality**
  - [ ] Add buttons to the sidebar for each feature (e.g., Disk Cleanup, Defragmentation).
  - [ ] Implement event handlers to switch views when a button is clicked.

- [ ] **Test Initial GUI Setup**
  - [ ] Run the application to ensure the navigation and basic framework work correctly.
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or issues related to the initial setup.

## Feature 1: Disk Cleanup Script
- [ ] **Create Disk Cleanup Script**
  - [ ] Develop a PowerShell or C# script to delete temporary files, system cache, and other junk files.
  - [ ] Test script functionality and validate results.

- [ ] **Integrate Script with GUI**
  - [ ] Design and implement GUI elements (buttons, checkboxes) for selecting file types to clean.
  - [ ] Link GUI buttons to the script to run the cleanup process.

- [ ] **Add Progress and Status Indicators**
  - [ ] Implement progress bars or indicators to show cleanup progress.
  - [ ] Display status messages for successful or failed cleanup.

- [ ] **Test and Debug Disk Cleanup Feature**
  - [ ] Perform testing for different scenarios (e.g., large files, different user permissions).
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.

- [ ] **Documentation and Usage Instructions**
  - [ ] Update README with instructions on using the Disk Cleanup feature.
  - [ ] Create user guides or tooltips in the app for better user understanding.

## Feature 2: Defragmentation Script
- [ ] **Create Defragmentation Script**
  - [ ] Develop a PowerShell or C# script to defragment specific drives.
  - [ ] Test script functionality and validate results.

- [ ] **Integrate Script with GUI**
  - [ ] Design GUI elements (dropdowns, buttons) for selecting drives and initiating defragmentation.
  - [ ] Link GUI buttons to the script to start the defragmentation process.

- [ ] **Add Progress and Status Indicators**
  - [ ] Implement progress bars to show the defragmentation progress.
  - [ ] Display status messages for completion or errors.

- [ ] **Test and Debug Defragmentation Feature**
  - [ ] Perform testing for different scenarios (e.g., multiple drives, different levels of fragmentation).
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.

- [ ] **Documentation and Usage Instructions**
  - [ ] Update README with instructions on using the Defragmentation feature.
  - [ ] Create user guides or tooltips in the app for better user understanding.

## Feature 3: Event Log Cleanup Script
- [ ] **Create Event Log Cleanup Script**
  - [ ] Develop a PowerShell or C# script to clear specified Windows Event Logs.
  - [ ] Test script functionality and validate results.

- [ ] **Integrate Script with GUI**
  - [ ] Design GUI elements (checkboxes, buttons) for selecting log types and clearing logs.
  - [ ] Link GUI buttons to the script to run the cleanup process.

- [ ] **Add Log Viewer Feature**
  - [ ] Implement a log viewer to display recent events before clearing.
  - [ ] Add filters and search functionality to the log viewer.

- [ ] **Test and Debug Event Log Cleanup Feature**
  - [ ] Perform testing for different log types and permissions.
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.

- [ ] **Documentation and Usage Instructions**
  - [ ] Update README with instructions on using the Event Log Cleanup feature.
  - [ ] Create user guides or tooltips in the app for better user understanding.

## Future Features (To be planned in subsequent sprints)
- [ ] **Inactive User Cleanup Script**
- [ ] **Software Update Script**
- [ ] **License Management Script**
- [ ] **System Backup and Restore Scripts**
- [ ] **Security Monitoring Script**
- [ ] **File Cleanup Script**
- [ ] **Security Audit Script**

## General Improvements and Enhancements
- [ ] **Refactor Code for Optimization**
  - [ ] Review code for performance improvements and best practices.
  - [ ] Refactor repetitive code into reusable functions or modules.

- [ ] **Enhance User Interface Design**
  - [ ] Improve the aesthetics and usability of the GUI.
  - [ ] Add accessibility features and responsive design elements.

- [ ] **Continuous Integration and Deployment**
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
  - [ ] Ensure the application is tested on different versions of Windows.

- [ ] **Gather User Feedback and Iterate**
  - [ ] Release MVP to early users and gather feedback.
  - [ ] Prioritize feedback and plan for subsequent sprints.
